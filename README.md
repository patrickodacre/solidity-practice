# Solidity Practice

This repo is a place for me to practice different approaches to using Solidity.

Write ups detailing self-contained lessons / examples will be posted to [BuildToLearn.io](http://buildtolearn.io)

You can also read through the code and git commit logs for comments and explanations.

Most (all) examples will include tests. I use [Buidler](https://buidler.dev).
